I recently picked up an interesting book called 'Weapons of Math Destruction', after being reccomended to me from a lecture. The author, Cathy O'Neil obtained a PhD in mathematics from Harvard. Her thesis was on algebraic number theory. Her ability to understand abstract theory in mathematics was swooped up by the hedgefund D.E Shaw, looking to power their investments through mathematical groundings. This is where Cathy saw the abuse of big data algorithms during the financial crisis and lead her to question the morality of their use.


She paints a marvelous description of such algorithms comparing them to weapons of mass destruction. She provides motivation for this likeness with excellent examples of how they have wreaked havoc on society, from college ranking machines to recidivism predictors. The underlying trend as to why she classifies such algorithms to Weapons of *Math* Destruction are the feedback loops (or the lack thereof) and the use of proxies where actual data is unfeasible to gather.

In order to develop a powerful and useful machine learning algorithm, it needs a target variable to learn from. A model can work well in the development phase and maybe even for sometime after that. However as we are all to well aware, relationships in the real world can and do change. Algorithms must have continous re learning and adaption through passing this feedback back into the machine. The model can then try to correct for it's mistakes the next time.

When the misclassification of an individual is just collateral damage absorbed by the user of that algorithm, the company can anticipate these costs. However, on the other end where the subject's approval or disapproval is a function of how they are classified can have disasterous compounded effects on society.

Cathy shows how the use of proxy variables can often spiral out of control and end up segergating society and become down right prejudice. This is a result of unfortunate correlation amongst someones race and say for example their postcodes, especially in the US.


I would highly reccomend this book to anyone, math background or not. Cathy beautifully paints a non technical background of a horrifiying truth.

The general data protection regulation (GDPR) implemented by the European Parliament needs to not only look at how to strengthen data protection but it also must regulate business and corporations on how they use there data and maintain their models. The viscous feedback loops as illustrated in Cathy's book must be stopped. Moreover, the US needs to take a strong look on how corporations use and gather their data. They have taken a big step back into the past socially into a world of inequity and prejudice as a result of their leap into the future.
