abstract_short="The intent of this paper is to analyse yearly changes in income inequality within a country during business cycles and ultimately, derive a relatonship between the variation in factor productivites and the level of income inequality within that country. World income inequality has shown a steady increasing trend over time. However, when we observe income inequality within a country, it appears to be a randomly fluctuating process with no discernible trend. We aim to explain these fluctuations of income inequality by fluctuating components of the business cycle. Large variations of income distribution can have negative socioeconomic effects. An understanding of such changes in income inequality can offer policy makers with insight in how to minimise increases in income inequality. Through an empirical analysis we hope to deliver policy makers such insight."
