abstract_short="An investigation into consumer behaviour when presented with a queue, with and without the expected duration of the queue, for a typical lunch in town i.e. if you knew how fast your fast food would be would you be more likely to line up for it? An initial observation of the natural queue every working day for two weeks, following which a non-intrusive nudge is introduced where by the members of the queue will be made aware of their expected waiting times in the form of a paper display in the window of the restaurant alongside which the queue forms. Data was collected by a GoPro camera outside the restaurant taking time-lapsed photos every half-second for two hours a day around lunchtime. The processed data was then analysed to fit a continuous time Poisson Process. concluding that the after recommencing the observations in the same manor with the addition of the nudge there existed an increase in both the average queue length and arrival rate implying that it perhaps increased the consumers willingness to queue."
