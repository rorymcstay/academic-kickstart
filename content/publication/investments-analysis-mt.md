In this project, completed in the second half of EC3050, we were asked to construct a fixed income portfolio with a level of risk aversion of our own choosing. In this case, a moderate level of risk was chosen. The investment stratergy was to diversify sub investment grade risk through choosing a portfolio consisting of many sub investment grade bonds.
